Multiple errors are occurring:\n1. \"TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object\" in removeChild operations\n2. \"TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'path')\" in applyProps\nThese errors suggest issues with React component lifecycle and Three.js object management. Change working directory to /workspace/shadcn-ui and investigate:\n1. Check for null/undefined refs in React components, especially in 3D visualization components\n2. Ensure all Three.js objects are properly initialized before use\n3. Add null checks for DOM operations and React refs\n4. Check for memory leaks or improper cleanup in useEffect hooks\n5. Verify that all Three.js geometries, materials, and meshes are properly disposed\n6. Add error boundaries around 3D components\n7. Test component mounting/unmounting cycles\n8. Rebuild and verify all errors are resolved", "task_type": "general", "code": "", "result": "", "is_success": false, "is_finished": false, "assignee": "Alex", "start_at": 1757792968.3739746}], "current_task_id": "1"}
